# Introduction to Scientific Computing with MATLAB

## Course Philosophy
This course adopts a "learning by doing" methodology where students engage directly with code implementation, debugging, and problem-solving. We believe in the pedagogical value of making mistakes and learning from them. During class sessions, we will work through problems together, encounter common pitfalls, and develop robust solutions collaboratively.
